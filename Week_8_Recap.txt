Status Update:
I reported a new issue that I found regarding the autocompletion function that I was working on and cleaned up my
completed addition of the local addition of the attribute autocompletion feature. I've also discussed with my project
lead regarding the blocking of the current issue I'm working on (#79) due to this new issue (#264). My plan is to start
considering methods of addressing this new issue I've found because I cannot move forward with adding on a new feature
to the autocompletion function when the function itself already doesn't work as intended. Issue 264 is the new blocker
that I am working to address. It involves revamping the entire logic of the Kestrel language autocompletion function,
so general knowledge regarding that and some optimization thoughts (their current system involves parsing text twice
and using a try + except loop).

Comments:
Because break is coming up, I have a lot of exams coming up, so my work on this might be on hold a little bit. I'm just
slowly compiling some information on autocompletion logic whenever I get a spot of time. I'm also trying to add some
more documentation on the issue as I'm going to make things easier when I do pick it up back in full.
